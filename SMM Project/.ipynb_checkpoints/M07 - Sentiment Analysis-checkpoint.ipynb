    "# Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, Sentiment Analysis is the task of identifying and extracting subjective information from a source material - in our case, our source material will exclusively be text. \n",
    "\n",
    "Defined as such, Sentiment Analysis is a *huge* subfield of text mining. It's hard to overstate how many routes you may take when the overarching goal is the identification of subjectivity. In today's lecture, we're only going to learn how to implement the most basic sentiment analysis approaches. If your final project merits a more sophisticated approach, then be sure to do your own reading and to consult with me when necessary. There's a reason why the final project is the only major graded component of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of you interested in Sentiment Analysis must be made aware (if you don't already know) that *the* canonical reference text, published in 2008 but still used today, is [the monograph *Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis* by Bo Pang and Lillian Lee](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/omsa/omsa.pdf). One reason why it has retained its salience (and gleaned over 5000 citations) is that it is primarily a treatise on the the *problem* of sentiment analysis, rather than a demonstration of a particular machine learning technique. As such, it remains relevant today. Much of today's talk and demos will be based, directly or indirectly, on Pang's article. That being said, **if you're considering working with sentiment for your final project, you should probably read the Pang monograph**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Polarity Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This is probably the first thing you think of when you hear the phrase \"sentiment analysis\", and this is the topic we'll be covering in today's lecture. Polarity classification is sentiment analysis in its most simple form. Is a sentence positive or negative? Assign a value of 1 if positive, or 0 if negative. Thumbs up or thumb down, good or bad, happy or sad. You have two mutually exclusively and oppositional *polarities* and you're assuming that a given text belongs to one or the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are an excellent polarity classifier. Assign the label \"positive\" or \"negative\" to the following sentences. \n",
    "\n",
    "* This movie was terrific! \n",
    "* This movie totally sucked!\n",
    "\n",
    "Trivially easy. But how do we train a computer to do the same thing? Morever, how do we train it to identify patterns in text such that it can continue to classify new, unseen, incoming texts as positive or negative?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think for a moment how you were able to quickly classify the above two example sentences. They're both sentences with 4 words, but the dead giveaway were the last words in each sentences. Those words were *adjectives* and they had a *clear polarity*. Terrific is a positive word, sucked is a negative word. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having observed this, we have a simple - but potentially effective - way to classify texts. Look in the texts, and see if they have positive or negative adjectives. Let's try this on some data. We'll analyze the most recent 2500 Tweets from both the Clinton and Trump accounts. I know you're probably getting tired of these accounts, but as I tried to come up with a different dataset, I realized that you really can't top the election when it comes to finding highly emotional and polarized tweets. \n",
    "\n",
    "I've already shown how to pull Tweets using the Tweepy API, so I've already downloaded the Tweets and saved them into a csv file using Pandas. Here, I'm loading it back into the Python environment. The csv file will be available on canvas. "

    "## Knowledge-Based Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The form of sentiment analysis we just conducted is known as a **knowledge-based** analysis. Why? Because we referred to a human-made, pre-existing knowledge base to make our sentiment classification decisions. Namely, a two-item knowledge base: \"good\" indicates a positive tweet, \"bad\" indicates a negative tweet. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to improve our classification scheme to account for some of the subtleties of human language. When it comes to using a knowledge-based technique, one way to improve things is to have a better knowledge base. Right now we're using only two words. How can we make this situation better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, one simple and obvious idea is to have *more indicator words*. We can make a *pool* of words that indicate positivity, and another pool of words indicating negativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing we can do is introduce a sort of score, rather than working in binary. Obviously, the word \"awful\" is stronger than the word \"bad.\" Maybe we can assign \"awful\" a value of -2 and bad a value of -1. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this manner, with a dictionary of positive words *and* their weights, and negative words *and* their weights, we can assign a *total score* to each Tweet by counting all of the positive negative words, finding their weights, and simply adding them together. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *biggest problem* with knowledge bases is that they must be manually created. You have to manually create a set of positive and negative words, and assign weights to them. This is tedious, and time consuming. \n",

    "Fortunately for us: several researchers have taken up this tedious work and have made lists of positive and negative words *and* assigned them weights. There are several to chose from, but in today's lecture we'll talk about using the [AFINN dataset by Finn Årup Nielsen](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010).\n",

To obtain a polarity score for a given text, simply identify all words in the text that are in AFINN, and add up their corresponding weight. If it's above 0, it's mostly positive, if it's below, it's mostly negative. Still a simple approach, similar to what we did above, but now we can use 2477 words with different weights rather than 2 words with 2 weights. How much improvement do we gain with this wider knowledge base?\n",

The quality of our sentiment judgements, of course, is reliant on the quality of our knowledge base. Here, we used AFINN, but there are a lot of options out there. \n",

    "## Making your own sentiment vocabulary using seeds\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be working with Tweets from a very specialized domain; the example we're using right now is a good illustration. These are political tweets, so words that indicate \"positive\" and \"negative\" sentiment in the political realm may not be the same as words that are positive or negative *generally*. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's possible if you're working in a specific domain like politics or product reviews, someone out there has already made a sentiment lexicon calibrated to your specific domain. If that's the case, you're in luck. More like than not, however, you won't find a pre-made lexicon. \n",
    "\n",
    "You'll therefore have to *make* a lexicon. You *could* do this manually, but that would demand a huge amount of energy, time, and human resources. Probably not feasible for the duration of this course. There is, however, one way to make a sentiment lexicon manually. This process was first introduced by [Turney in a 2002 paper](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P02-1053.pdf) and involves starting with a small set of *seed words* that are positive or negative, and then *finding words that are strongly associated with those seed words*. Simply stated, if a word consistently appears with the word *bad*, then it, too, must carry some sort of negative sentiment. We *propogate* the negativity or positivity from the seed words to other words in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'll demonstrate this approach here, but with the **strong caveat** that since this is a relatively small dataset, it probably won't work well. If you decide to take this route, I strongly advise you collect far more data than 5000 Tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pointwise Mutual Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Pointwise Mutual Information, or PMI, is a measurement of how strongly associated two words are given a corpus and a unit of analysis. It is given by the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{PMI}(a, b) = \\text{log}\\frac{P(a, b)}{P(a) \\cdot P(b)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $P(a, b)$ is the probability that both a and b appear in the same unit of analysis (like a sentence, tweet, or document), while $P(a)$ is the probability that a appears in a unit and $P(b)$ is the probability that b appears in a unit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind this formula is that if two words appear together more often than we would expect them to appear by chance, then they are strongly associated. The numerator represents how likely they are to appear together, the denominator represents how often we expect them appear together by chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we take Tweets to be our unit of analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $P(a, b)$ is simply the number of Tweets that a and b appear together divided by the total number of tweets\n",
    "* $P(a)$ is the number of Tweets that a appears in, divided by the total number of tweets\n",
    "* $P(b)$ is the number of Tweets that b appears in, divided by the total number of tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Semantic Orientation of a Word\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a set of positive and negative seed words. We'll call the positive seed words $V^{+}$ and the negative seed words $V^{-}$. Let's go ahead and make these sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V^{+} = \\{\\text{good}, \\text{great}, \\text{better}\\} \\\\\n",
    "V^{-} = \\{\\text{bad}, \\text{terrible}, \\text{worse}\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The semantic orientation of a word is simply the sum of its PMIs with the positive seed words, minus the sum of its PMIs with negative seed words. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{SO}(w) = \\sum_{v^{+} \\in V^{+}} \\text{PMI}(w, v^{+}) - \\sum_{v^{-} \\in V^{-}} \\text{PMI}(w, v^{-})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the semantic orientation for all the words in your corpus, you have something similar to the AFINN lexicon - each word has a positive or negative word associated it. From there, you can iterate through all your tweets. \n",
    "\n",
    "The step-by-step process of getting from a corpus and seed words to a list of words with semantic orientations is pretty complex, so I've written a function here that will do the work for you. You can copy and paste this code into your own if you wish to take this approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function ``getso`` takes four arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``seed_pos``: a list containing the positive seed words\n",
    "* ``seed_neg``: a list containing the negative seed words\n",
    "* ``texts``: an iterable containing the raw texts\n",
    "* ``min_df``: an integer, meaning \"minimum document frequency\". This tells the function to ignore all words that appear less than ``min_df`` times in the corpus. This will remove outliers that appear infrequently and therefore are noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns a dictionary. The keys of the dictionary are words, their corresponding values are the SO calculated for that word."

Choosing *more* seed words would also help.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Supervised vs. Unsupervised\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that our attempts to identify the sentiment polarity of Tweets has been, up to this point, **entirely unsupervised**. We have had to rely on some sort of *external knowledge base* like AFINN to assign some sort of quantitative measure of polarity. What we have *not* done is take a set of labeled examples, train a classifier on it, and run some evaluations on it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "The key problem is *labeled data*. In order to get a bunch of tweets and used supervised learning to classify their sentiment, we need some *labeled data* to train the classifier. But for the task at hand, we don't have any labeled data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we have used supervised learning methods to predict the species of an Iris, or to predict whether or not a Tweet came from iPhone or Android. In all those scenarios, the labels were provided for us, either automatically (in the case of Twitter, which provides tweet source as a property), or manually (some 19th century botanist both measured the Irises and determined their species). \n",
    "\n",
    "But we don't have that luxury here. We don't have any means to know beforehand whether a Tweet is positive or negative - that's why we're trying to figure out the sentiment in the first place. Lacking a labeled dataset, we have to resort to these rather imprecise unsupervised methods to determine polarity. Since it's unsupervised, it suffers one of the characteristic drawbacks of all unsupervised learning: there's no systematic way to evaluate it. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How to get to supervised learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're not attempting to predict a feature that is *automatically* provided to us by the Twitter environment, we'll have to find a way to get labeled data if we want to use some form of supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manually Labeling a set of Tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "This involves subsetting your tweets and manually identifying them as positive or negative. This is extremely difficult and tedious work, but someone eventually has to do it. It is best practice to have multiple people annotate tweets and then compare the results. The degree to which the results of different coders match is called \"Inter-rate Reliability\", and usually only manual annotations with high IRR are considered acceptable for publication. Another route to take is to hire a service such as Amazon Mechanical Turk to annotate the tweets, \"crowdsourcing\" the work. If you have enough Turkers do the work, then you can measure the IRR among them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using an existing dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're lucky, someone has already labeled a dataset relevant to your research interest. Assuming they have provided many samples with high-quality annotations, you can simply train a classifier on their data, and then use that classifier to classify your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Find something in your data to serve as a proxy for sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "If neither of the above two options are available to you, one alternative is to find some indicator in the data you *do* have to serve as an unambiguous proxy for positive or negative sentiment. For example, you could operate with the assumption that every tweet that contains a smiling emoticon, \":)\", is a positive tweet, while one containing a sad emoticon, \":(\", is a negative one. You could train a classifier to classify this subset of tweets, and then use that classifier to classify the rest of your tweets that did not have such emoticons.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Supervised Learning Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we're going to train a sentiment classifier using a combination of approaches 2 and 3 described above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment140 is a classifier that allows you discover teh sentiment of a brand, product, or topic on Twitter. The designers of the classifier used a dataset containing 1,600,000 tweets to train it. All the tweets in this dataset end in either a smiling emoticon \":)\" or a negative emoticon \":(\". Positive tweets were assigned a label of 4, negative tweets a label of 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "The designers have graciously made their training data public, so what we'll do is use their training data - and the labels that come with them - to train a classifier, and *then* use that classifier to make predictions on new, unseen data: namely, our Clinton/Trump tweets.  \n",
