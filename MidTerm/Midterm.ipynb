    "# Task 1 - Getting tweets (3 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pick either two Twitter usernames. These usernames should be \"oppositional\" in nature. I'm leaving the exact meaning of the term \"oppositional\" intentional vague; the two usernames you pick should be in the same domain (politics, products, pop culture, etc.) but should also be strong contrasts or even rivals. For example:  @Apple vs. @SamsungMobile, @SenMajLdr vs. @SenSchumer, @CocaCola vs. @pepsi, @OfficialKanye vs. @taylorswift13. Basically, if the two handles/hashtags you pick can sensibly fit into the phrase \"A vs. B,\" then they're oppositional.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code block below, use the twitter API to get **the text** of 500 tweets representing the two usernames you pick - specifically, the 500 most recent tweets of the users. Please pick users that tweet primarily in English. This \"English\" requirement is simply so the two instructors can go through the information. This means you'll have a total of 1000 tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do NOT pick any of the examples I gave above above as your two oppositional usernames. Think up an original pair. Note that this task requires you to come up with two \"oppositional\" entities as well as to get those entities most recent tweets. Keep in mind that this is an individual assignment. Any two students who happen to pick the same two oppositional entities may be double checked for cheating, therefore, the more \"original\" your oppositional pair, the better. Any two students who have exactly the same set of tweets will draw a high amount of suspicion, since it is highly unlikely students will a) pick the same entities and b) get their tweets at exactly the same time.**"

This will remove frequent words - which show up all the time and therefore are not informative - and infrequent words, which are so rare as to just be noise. If you pass these arguments a float, that float represents the proportion of documents (e.g. `max_df=0.9` means, remove all words that show up in more than 90% of the tweets) and if you pass these arguments an integer, that integer represents the number of documents (e.g. `min_df=5`, remove all words that show up in less than 5 document). \n",

If you want to know the index of a word (that is, which column in $d$ corresponds to that word), you can consult this dictionary. Suppose you named your vectorizer `vec`.
